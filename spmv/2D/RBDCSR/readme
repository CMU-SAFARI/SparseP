Common Issues
- NR_DPUS needs to be a multiple of the number of vertical partitions
- BLNC_TSKLT_ROW, BLNC_TSKLT_NNZ are used interchangeably (only one of them needs to be set to 1)
- CG_TRANS, FG_TRANS are used interchangeably (only one of them needs to be set to 1)
- For 24 tasklets, define the sequential reader to be smaller, (i.e., #define SEQREAD_CACHE_SIZE 128). Otherwise, program exceeds the 64KB WRAM memory.
