Common Issues
- NR_DPUS needs to be a multiple of the number of vertical partitions
- CGLOCK, FGLOCK, LOCKFREE are used interchangeably (only one of them needs to be set to 1)
- CPU-DPU Transfers - possible options:
    - CG_TRANS=1, YFG_TRANS=0, FG_TRANS=0 --> Coarse-grained data transfers for input and output vectors
    - CG_TRANS=0, YFG_TRANS=1, FG_TRANS=1 --> Fine-grained data transfers only for output vector
    - CG_TRANS=0, YFG_TRANS=0, FG_TRANS=1 --> Fine-grained data transfers for both the input and output vectors
